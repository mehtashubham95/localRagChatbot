# Local LLM Chatbot with RAG for PDF Interaction

This repository delivers a robust, locally-runnable chatbot leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide precise, context-aware responses based on information extracted from PDF documents. By ingesting your PDFs, the chatbot constructs a searchable knowledge base, enabling accurate answers grounded strictly in your data.

## Features

- **Local LLM Integration:** Run a large language model entirely on your local machine, ensuring absolute privacy and control over your data. No data leaves your environment.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enhance response relevance by retrieving targeted information from PDFs prior to generation.
- **PDF Ingestion:** Seamlessly load and process PDF documents to build a domain-specific knowledge base.
- **Contextual Responses:** Engage in natural language conversations with answers directly tied to your document content.
- **Prompt-Driven Interaction:** Easily customize the assistantâ€™s behavior by editing prompt templates, enabling flexible adaptation to diverse use cases.
- **Open and Free:** Fully open-source and free to use, with no hidden costs or data sharing.

## Use Cases

While demonstrated here with financial bank statements and budgeting advice, this framework is designed for broad applicability. As a senior data scientist, you can adapt it to:

- Research assistants analyzing scientific papers
- Legal document review and summarization
- Personal knowledge management systems
- Corporate compliance and audit support
- Any domain requiring private, document-grounded AI assistance

Simply provide relevant PDFs and tailor the prompt templates to your domain-specific needs.
